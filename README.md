🔍 Project Overview

The project examines how secondary Canadian airports (beyond the major hubs of YYZ, YVR, and YUL) function in the international air travel network. It analyses:

Overall route volumes for select secondary airports

Their international route volumes and unique destination reach

Key airports that serve as international gateways

Factors driving international route demand (economy, geography, population catchment, airline strategy)

The major airlines operating international routes from these airports

📊 What You’ll Find Here

Raw datasets in CSV format

SQL queries to replicate analyses

Python scripts for generating charts and tables

Visualizations ready for report or presentation use

✅ Key insights

YYC (Calgary) emerges as the most globally connected secondary airport, with diverse routes to Europe, Asia, and the U.S.

YEG (Edmonton) primarily serves North American destinations, while YHZ (Halifax) and YOW (Ottawa) provide seasonal and business links to Europe and the Caribbean.

Smaller secondary airports have limited international reach, reflecting regional population and demand dynamics.

Airline strategies, geography, and regional economies play critical roles in determining which airports expand globally.
